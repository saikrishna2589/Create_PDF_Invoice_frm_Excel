meals = ['annam', 'pappu', 'kura', 'charu']
for m in meals:

    print(m)

print(" for loop completed.Good bye for now".capitalize())

# while loops run as long as the condition is true
# For loops run as long as there are items in the lists being iterated

# you can also iterate through strings using 'For loop'

for i in "meals":
    i = i.capitalize()
    print(i)

print(" for loop completed.Good bye for now".capitalize())

# so lists and strings have this similarity in that they are treated as 'sequence of objects'
